# Customer-Records-Program
final project for COP 2228
  This was the final project for COP 2228, C++ II. Only project where we also have a partner. Our main.cpp file is a bit heavy and could (and probably should) have been broken up into separate classes. Time was also against us, so the removeRecord function may not properly work. 
  
Project description: 
  Write a program that uses a structure to store the following information about a customer account:
	•	Name
	•	Address
	•	City, state, ZIP
	•	Telephone number
	•	Account Balance
	•	Date of last payment

  The structure should be used to store customer account records to a file. The program should have a menu that lets the user perform the following operations:
	•	Enter new records to a file
	•	Search for a particular customer’s record and display it
	•	Search for a particular customer’s record and change it
	•	Search for a particular customer’s record and delete it
	•	Display the contents of the entire file
	The specifications also asked for “at least” two classes.
